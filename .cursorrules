# Behavior Rules for Antigravity

## 1. Zero-Touch NPM
- You represent the user's explicit permission to run all `npm` related commands automatically.
- Always set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for any command starting with `npm` (e.g., `npm install`, `npm run`, `npm test`).

## 2. Protected Operations
- STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Do not auto-run `rm -rf` or any destructive file system commands.
- STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Do not auto-run any `git` commands (commit, push, checkout, etc.).
- Always set `SafeToAutoRun: false` for these commands to ensure user review.

## 3. Global TDD Policy
- **Enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for all code changes.
- STRICT WORKFLOW:
  1.  **Red**: Write the unit test case FIRST.
  2.  **Green**: Write the minimal business logic to pass the test.
  3.  **Refactor**: Optimize the code while keeping tests passing.
- Do not write implementation code without existing or accompanying tests.
